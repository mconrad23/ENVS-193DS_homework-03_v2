#1. Personal data 

##a. Data summarizing 

[To summarize my data in order to compare the response variable between categories, I should calculate the mean length of study sessions for each type of music to compare how different music genres might affect how long I am studying. This comparison would be informative because the type of music may influence focus and productivity, potentially leading to longer or shorter study sessions depending on the genre.]
